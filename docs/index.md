## Welcome to Vaccine Maps
VaccineMap is OpenTable for vaccines. We're obviously initially focused on the Covid-19 vaccine, but there is a sustainable market for reserving flu-shots, 

Vaccine Map helps people find locations to receive a Covid-19 vaccine or flu shot, then schedule a time to receive the shot.

Vaccine map is a business. We are compensated by the company that administers the vaccine.

## Operations
Intially VaccineMap is a website running on a Django webserver. 
Later, we will create iOS and Android applications.

## How we get data
Users upload data about the availablity of vaccines.

For example, a user uploads the following, which is structured so that it can generate a map. "The CVS at 123 Main Street told me that they have 12 prime and 23 booster doses available for Group 2 users. ID required. 

Partners use our API or website to upload information about the availability of vaccines and time slots to administer those vaccines. 

## NABC
90% of startups will fail because they don't build something that actually delivers deep and compelling value to a large market.

Before coding a single line, we can talk to customers and do research to find out whether this idea is even worth pursuing. If the idea is worh pursuing, then this pitch should hold water:
#### Need 
Consumers to get vaccinated for Covid-19 and other diseases. Businesses that administer vaccines need customers. 
#### Approach
VacineMaps provides a map showing where vaccines are available.

Users sign reserve a time to receive a vaccine.

Reservations and vaccine availablility are managed through a company dashboard or through and API.

VaccineMaps is compensated per reserved-vaccine-administered. 
#### Competition
The alternative to VaccineMaps is to reserve an appointment directly through a provider. 

##### Benefits
Not all providers in all 50 states will have fully functioning websites. They will need a partner, and we will be ready for them when their own tech fails. 

Within California, if we assume that CVS and Walgreen's websites function as intended, the advantage of VaccineMaps over going directly to the provider is that VaccineMaps shows the availability across all providers. Users will only need to put information in once. 
##### Costs
The website will be faster and easier to use than either CVS or Walgreen's website, so the cost to using it is low. 



## Reason's this company shouldn't exist
1. People will know through word-of-mouth where to get a vaccine, and they will contact those sources directly. 
2. Walgreens and CVS already have a website that allows you to book a vaccine. They won't stumble with updating their website
3. The seriousness of Covid-19 will force companies to clearly communicate the availability of vaccines.0
4. Other user-generated-content websites that aggregate data will pop-up because they have already proven themselves to be simple and effective in Taiwan.
5. The company won't be able to pivot once herd-immunity is reached for Covid-19. 

## Operational risks
1. The sales team could fail to get companies to pay us for the service.
2. Partners can't be bothered to integrate with our reservation system, or to even have humans log in daily to offer reservation slots through the system.
3. Hacking or information security issue causes breach of customer data.
