## Welcome to Vaccine Maps
VaccineMap is OpenTable for vaccines. We're obviously initially focused on the Covid-19 vaccine, but there is a sustainable market for flu-shots and 

Vaccine Map helps people find locations to receive a Covid-19 vaccine or flu shot, then schedule a time to receive the shot.

Vaccine map is a business. We are compensated by the company that administers the vaccine.

## Operations
Intially VaccineMap is a website running on a Django webserver. 
Later, we will create iOS and Android applications.

## How we get data
Users upload data about the availablity of vaccines.

For example, a user uploads the following, which is structured so that it can generate a map. "The CVS at 123 Main Street told me that they have 12 prime and 23 booster doses available for Group 2 users. ID required. 

Partners use our API or website to upload information about the availability of vaccines and time slots to administer those vaccines. 

## NABC
90% of startups will fail because they don't build something that actually delivers deep and compelling value to a large market.

Before coding a single line, we can talk to customers and do research to find out whether this idea is even worth pursuing. If the idea is worh pursuing, then this pitch should hold water:
#### Need 
Consumers to get vaccinated for Covid-19 and other diseases. Businesses that administer vaccines need customers. 
#### Approach
VacineMaps

1. People will know through word-of-mouth where to get a vaccine, and they will contact those sources directly.

2. The seriousness of Covid-19 will force companies to clearly communicate the availability of vaccines.
3. Other user-generated-content websites that aggregate data will pop-up because they have already proven themselves to be simple and effective in Taiwan.
